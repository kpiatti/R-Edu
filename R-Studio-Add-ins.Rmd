################## ESQUISSE ADD-IN ###############
This add-in allows you to build ggplot2 plots using a drag and drop GUI, and then export or copy/paste the code into your script or markdown file. 

This is a test drive using the cleanbeaches data

```{r}
cleanbeaches <- read.csv(here("Data", "cleanbeaches.csv"))

#launch the esquisee interface
esquisse::esquisser(cleanbeaches)


ggplot(cleanbeaches) +
 aes(x = site, y = beachbugs) +
 geom_violin(adjust = 1L, scale = "area", fill = "#bd3786") +
 labs(x = "Beach Site", y = "Beachbug levels", title = "Built Using Esquisser Add-in Drag & Drop") +
 ggthemes::theme_base()
```
