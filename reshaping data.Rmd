## INTRODUCTION

this is the rmd i'm creating as i'm going through the clean it up # 5 tutorial from ryouwithme

here is the [link to tutorial](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/02-cleanitup-5/)

reshaping data from wide to long and long to wide is sometimes necessary. for most projects to work with r functions your data needs to be in long format. 

p.s. i'm also using this to continue practicing and learning git/github


## Wide vs. Long Format

wide format data has individual observational units (e.g. people, beaches) spread across many columns. it look like this
![wide format data](wide format data.png)
long format data puts those individual observational units in a single column and look like this: 
![long format data](long format data.png)
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

```{r}
wide_data <-   read.csv(here("Data", "beaches_wide.csv"))
```

```{r}
#pivot wide data to long
beaches_long <- wide_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "site",
               values_to = "buglevels",
               `Bondi.Beach`: `Tamarama.Beach`)
```
