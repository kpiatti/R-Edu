## INTRODUCTION

this is the rmd i'm creating as i'm going through the clean it up # 5 tutorial from ryouwithme

here is the [link to website](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/02-cleanitup-5/)

reshaping data from wide to long and long to wide is sometimes necessary. for most projects to work with r functions your data needs to be in long format. 

p.s. i'm also using this to continue practicing and learning git/github


## Wide vs. Long Format
